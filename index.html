    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am currently a student at Towson University, expecting to graduate in Spring 2025
        with a degree in Computer Information Systems. I enjoy reading, playing video games,
        and ultimate frisbee. Additionally, I play on the ultimate frisbee club team here at
        Towson. Cats are awesome and I have one of my own named Wilbur. After I graduate, I
        intend to pursue a career in data analytics or human computer interactions.
